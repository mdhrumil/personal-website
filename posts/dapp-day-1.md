Welcome to Day 1 of this journey.

Today I read the first chapter of the book: [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) - What is Ethereum?

In the first chapter, I learned a different perspective on Ethereum. Ethereum is also known as the world computer. It is a decentralized, singleton computer that can run programs known as smart contracts in its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and those programs can control the flow of money.
The experience of writing code in Solidity feels very similar to writing Javascript. But with Solidity, one can also create transactions to send and receive money. It feels like automating the role of big companies managing financial transactions.

New concept learned:
Geth: Geth is an Ethereum node implementation written in the Go programming language. Using Geth, one can run an Ethereum node on their local machine and use it to verify blocks of transactions on Ethereum and mine Ether.

If you're reading this, thank you.
