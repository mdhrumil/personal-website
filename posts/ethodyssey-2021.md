title: 'My experience with ETHOdyssey hackathon'

It's been a while since I last posted anything on my blog. I've been occupied with sharpening my Solidity sword and developing some cool projects. I have participated in Devfolio's ETHOdyssey hackathon which is a month long hackathon for developing cool stuff on crypto. My project idea for the hackathon is an NFT marketplace where fans of a celebrity can buy their "superfans" spots. There are three class of superfans spots - Platinum, Gold, & Silver, and each of them are in limited quantities. The superfans spots can also be put for re-sale once bought. So far, I have managed to develop the backend of the application, and I'm yet to develop the frontend. I'm thinking of putting together a very basic frontend for the app, because alongside I also want to focus on getting started with Solana.


Solana has been there for quite a while and is one of the serious competitors to Ethereum. I'm planning to participate in another month long hackathon, Building Out Loud, by Solana India. It will be a great learning experience, and I'm looking forward to submit a rocking project submission for both the hackathons.

Hackathons are really cool. I've been attending them since my mid-undergrad years, and I've always learned a lot from all of them. There are a lot many hackathons in the crypto space and a lot of developers are onboarding with crypto development everyday. These are exciting times. Crypto has a huge potential and just like I say it to everyone I meet: The future, is decentralized.
