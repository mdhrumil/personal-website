Today was an important day for me. I gave my first interview for a Smart Contracts engineering position at one of the early-stage startups. I have been exploring the blockchain space for a few months now, and my interest in the field is growing exponentially day by day. 
Back to the interview, it was a 30 minutes chat with the startup's CEO and one of its engineers. I messed up. I was heavily under-prepared, and I realized I had a long way to go. But one good thing that happened from it is that it has put me on a path that I was searching for, for a few weeks. Now that I know what I need to do to become an expert in Solidity and DApp development, I have decided to document everything that I study related to Solidity and DApp development in my blog. Buckle up readers, the journey to explore the beautiful world of DApp development begins today!
